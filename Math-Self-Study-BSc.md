# How I would Begin Studying Math in 2023

Here are some recommendations about studying math with the (subjectively) best available resources. **WORK IN PROGRESS**.

### My boy's wicked smart
[This line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIdsjNGCGz4&t=178s) from Good Will Hunting, 26 years later, is even more poignant, taking into account the fact that these days you don't even need to pay those 1.50$ late charges, and the fact that Youtube wasn't even someone's dream back then. Anyway, If I were to go about saving those (1997 inflation *unadjusted*) 150K USD college fees, **I'd do it like this:**

### Calculus
1. **Watch** the [essence of calculus series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus) by 3Blue1Brown.
2. **Read** the [five college calculus course](https://www.science.smith.edu/~callahan/intromine.html). It covers calc 1,2, differential equations and some numerical methods while putting everything in context of applications and focusing on understanding as opposed to formula manipulation.
3. **Watch** the calc 1 and 2 video series by [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTreforBazett).
4. **Bonus:** read [Calculus Reordered](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691181318/calculus-reordered) for a historical POV, or watch [this 30 min video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M2RWtD4EzI) instead.

### Linear algebra and advanced calculus
1. **Watch** the [linear algebra series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) by 3Blue1Brown.
2. **Watch**  Prof. Gilbert Strang's classic lectures ([linear algebra 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D)).
3. **Read** [this book](https://matrixeditions.com/5thUnifiedApproach.html). It starts with a great intro to linear algebra and goes all the way to calc 3 and 4, in the same spirit as the five college book.
4. After reading the linear algebra part of the previous entry, **read** [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net/). It's great but a bit abstract.
5. **Watch** the calc 3 and 4  series by [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTreforBazett).

### Geometry
1. **Flip through** [Geometry and the Imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_and_the_Imagination). You won't understand "why" by reading this book, but something there *will* spark your interest.   
2. **Read** [Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-39799-3) and **only afterwards** [VDGF](https://www.vdgf.space/about-me), to see how Newton would have done it.

### Probability, stats, machine learning
1. **Start** out with Sheldon Ross' [A First Course in Probability](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/first-course-in-probability-a/P200000006334/9780137504589), it's a classic.
2. MacKay's book [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) is the **best** treatment of advanced (applied) material.
3. **look at** [Probability with Martingales](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/probability-with-martingales/B4CFCE0D08930FB46C6E93E775503926#overview) for a wonderful treatment of the theoretical side. This one can also serve as an intro to **measure theory**. 

### One offs
1. **Complex Analysis:** [VCA](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/visual-complex-analysis-9780192868923) is the precursor to VDGF (see above, under geometry).
2. **Nonlinear Dynamics:** Strogatz's [book](https://www.google.co.il/books/edition/Nonlinear_Dynamics_and_Chaos/1kpnDwAAQBAJ) is a masterpiece of math exposition. This is where you *really* understand how ODEs work.
3. If you happen to speak **German**, [this](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-62618-4) is a wonderful **overview of mathematics**, targeting CS students.

**General Note:** I've collected some interactive resources I like [here](https://github.com/Idan-Alter/Interactive-Explainers). You might want to give them a spin as you go about your studies.
