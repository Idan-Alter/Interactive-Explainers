# How I would Begin Studying Math in 2023

Here are some thoughts about studying math with the (subjectively) best available resources. **Work in [eternal] progress**.

### Calculus
1. Watch the [essence of calculus series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus) by 3Blue1Brown.
2. Read the [five college calculus course](https://www.science.smith.edu/~callahan/intromine.html). It covers calc 1,2, differential equations and some numerical methods while putting everything in context of applications and focusing on understanding as opposed to formula manipulation.
3. Watch the calc 1 and 2 video series by [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTreforBazett).
4. **Bonus:** read [Calculus Reordered](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691181318/calculus-reordered) for a historical POV, or watch [this 30 min video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M2RWtD4EzI) instead.

### Linear Algebra and Advanced Calculus
1. Watch the [linear algebra series](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) by 3Blue1Brown.
2. Watch  Prof. Gilbert Strang's classic lectures ([linear algebra 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D)).
3. Read [this book](https://matrixeditions.com/5thUnifiedApproach.html). It starts with a great intro to linear algebra and goes all the way to calc 3 and 4, in the same spirit as the five college book. 
4. Watch the calc 3 and 4  series by [Dr. Trefor Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrTreforBazett).

### Geometry
1. Flip through [Geometry and the Imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_and_the_Imagination). You won't understand "why" by reading this book, but something tjere might spark your interest.   
2. read [Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-39799-3) and only afterwards [VDGF](https://www.vdgf.space/about-me) to see how Newton would have done it.
